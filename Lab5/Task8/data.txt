The future is not set. Or is it? Modern science allows us to predict some future events that are about to happen
(for example, a weather tomorrow), but how about something that will happen 100,0001 years from now? What about
1,000,0002 years? With the power of biology and physics we can go that far. And maybe even further than that!
