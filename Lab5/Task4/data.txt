Chemistry is the study of matter and its properties. Chemists use their knowledge to create new materials and develop
new solutions to problems in a wide range of fields, including nanotechnology, biotechnology, drug discovery, biology,
medicine. Chemists are also working to develop new sources of renewable energy and to minimize waste. For decades,
chemists have been finding applications for renewable matter, which is important because oil is not an infinite
resource. In addition to its research and development, chemistry is also essential to our everyday life.
The toothpaste we use, the clothes we wear and the medicines we take are all the products of chemistry.
